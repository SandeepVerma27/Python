-------INNER WORKING OF PYTHON---------
.py extension
interpreter

python files make bytes codes-->(hide ,**pychache** )

--Byte Code --> Python VM(Vertual machin)-----> byte code is execute on the PVM

.py-------->Bytecode(MostlyHidden)-------->Python(VM)

-byte code run fast
-byte code is low level code (plateform independant)
-.pyc---->compilled python (frozen Binaries)

\_ _pycache_ \_
-system file for python only use enternly this type of the python use for internaly work

- \_ _iportance_ \_
  .python-312.pyc
  -changes for track in codes
  -cpython (standard version)
  -312(version) -
  only work for imported file

      ------------PVM------
      python vertual machine

  -software to execute code in loop.
  -Code loop to iterate byte code (one by one)
  -Run time engine(need to run the code) PVM.
  -so called the interpreter.
  -Byte code is NOT Machine Code.(machin code is produced by the assembly language)
  -only for byte code is python specific(that generated by the python file)
  -cpython(standard python), jpython, IronPython ,stackless, pypy
