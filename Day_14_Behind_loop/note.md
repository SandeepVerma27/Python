<!----------iteration tool---------------->

import math
this tutorial is inportant for the python

f=open('filename')
f.readline()

f.**next**

for line in open('chai.py'):
print(line,end="")

-file has own iterator tool

iter('variable')---> check the it itrable or not
\_ _next_ \_.()

--------note summary ---------------
Python's loops have some reimagining behind the scenes
00:02
Python has a different implementation of loops compared to other languages, providing a unique perspective for understanding them.
The behind-the-scenes process involves creating iteration tools, offering a different approach to looping.
✦
Python iteration tools include for loop and comprehensions
02:21
Python iteration tools also include map and are not part of Iterator tool
Iteration tools only work on iterable objects like lists, strings, and files
✦
Iterable objects point to start location of memory and enable looping
06:27
Iteratable objects provide the memory address of the start point and the next value
Using 'next' method, you can print values one by one until Stop Iteration Exception is raised
✦
Basic file handling and script creation in Python
08:38
Instructions for creating a new folder and file for writing Python script
Explanation of basic code for file handling and script creation
✦
Python read line method handling exceptions and file iteration
13:07
read line method handling stop iteration exception and returning string
Usage of iteration tools and impracticality of read lines method due to heavy memory usage
✦
Using while loop to read files in Python.
15:03
Explains how to open a file using while loop and the syntax involved.
Describes how to read lines one by one using while loop and the use of 'break' statement.
✦
Introduction to iter tools in Python
19:04
Iter tools provide various functions for efficient iteration.
Iterable objects in Python can be utilized with iter tools for enhanced functionality.
✦
Understanding memory references and iteration in Python
20:49
Memory reference and value of variables in loops
Behavior of list iterator and common interview questions about it
✦
Storing a file in a variable creates a reference, not a new object.
24:54
The name in memory reference of the file does not create a new iterated object, it is just a reference to the actual object.
File handling in Python is important due to these differences and lack of understanding of basics by many.
✦
Understanding the concept of iteration and the usage of 'next'.
26:49
The use of 'next' as a small hack for iteration.
Explaining the behavior of 'next' in different scenarios and its application in various contexts.
